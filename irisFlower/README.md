# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors

Welcome to my **Iris flower classifier** project!  
This is a simple yet educational Python program that uses the classic Iris dataset and the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify iris flowers by species.  
It's designed for learning purposes and to track my progress in machine learning.
